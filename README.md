# Book title-to-cover WGAN-GP

**Goal:** generate a book cover given a title.  Work-in-progress.

It is not generating decent images.  I think it is a dataset issue; that is, there may not be enough in common between
the information in the titles, nor between related covers.  Maybe an attention-based model could overcome this?
I am leaving this aside for now.  

Switched to the MNIST digit dataset to test if the code was working. The MNIST digit model works fine.
