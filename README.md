# Book title-to-cover GAN
- - - - 
**Goal:** generate a book cover given a title.  Work-in-progress.  
It is not working.  I think it is a dataset issue; that is, not enough in common between the information 
in the titles, nor between related covers.  
Switched to the MNIST digit dataset to test if the code was working. The MNIST digit model works fine.  
Migrated to a WGAN-GP model.
