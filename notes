Write dataset loader first
For hints on loading a dataset from a folder of images look here:

----- Outline -----

1. Tokenize book title
2. Embed tokenized title (converts word indices to vectors)
3. Feed this to an RNN (https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn#create_the_text_encoder)
    But we will output a generated image rather than a sentiment verdict
    The RNN generates the seed for the generated image (but not a 1 digit seed)
    Look here for ideas on image generation (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan#the_generator)
4. Now pass generated image to a discriminator


----- Miscellaneous -----
As of 2021.07.31, needed to use Numpy version 1.19.5 rather than the latest versions due to some compatibility issue
between TensorFlow and later versions.  See:
