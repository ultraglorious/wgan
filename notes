Write dataset loader first
For hints on loading a dataset from a folder of images look here:
    https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning#preprocess_the_images_using_inceptionv3


----- Outline -----

1. Tokenize book title
2. Embed tokenized title (converts word indices to vectors)
3. Feed this to an RNN (https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn#create_the_text_encoder)
    But we will output a generated image rather than a sentiment verdict
    The RNN generates the seed for the generated image (but not a 1 digit seed)
    Look here for ideas on image generation (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan#the_generator)
4. Now pass generated image to a discriminator


----- Miscellaneous -----
As of 2021.07.31, needed to use Numpy version 1.19.5 rather than the latest versions due to some compatibility issue
between TensorFlow and later versions.  See:

----- MNIST Digit WGAN Log Notes -----
20210812-164023 -- Initial run
20210812-175157 -- Added batch normalization to generator convolution blocks
20210812-193513 -- Added final, 1-stride ConvBlock layer to Discriminator.  Filters now go 32-64-128
20210812-195207 -- Changed all ConvBlocks in the discriminator to 128 filter
20210813-133415 -- Ran for 20 epochs.  Discriminator training seemed to be going okay, but the image quality is poor.
20210813-135426 - Added GaussianNoise layer to Discriminator.  Went to G-(5-1-128)-(5-2-64)-(5-2-1), D-(5-2-64)-(5-2-128)
20210813-152023 - Implemented gradient penalty method. Removed weight clipping, changed to Adam optimizer, removed normalization from Discriminator

----- Book title-to-cover WGAN Log Notes -----
20210816-112821 -- Initial run of title2cover using WGAN with gradient penalty (20 epochs)
20210816-114817 -- Same as above, but and additional 30 epochs.  The images looked bad but the metrics looked good I think.
